# WholeBrainIsingModel
pipeline for fitting Ising models to fMRI data and comparing the parameters to brain structural features

archive_2025_06_09: all the code that we wrote for the Ising model analyses prior to the June 2025 paper submission
We wrote these files in a separate, private Git repository and copied them here.
The original repository contains some sensitive data.

We also used some code written by Daniel Kristanto et al. for their paper
